				<h2>All about "Hello, World!" programs</h2>
				<h3>The very first program of many programmers in the world</h3>
				<p>
					A "Hello, World!" program is a computer program that outputs or displays "Hello, World!" to a user.
					Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax
					of a programming language for a working program, and as such is often the very first program people write

				<h4>Variations</h4>
				<ol>
					<li>the presence or absence of the comma and exclamation mark</li>
					<li>the capitalization of the 'H', both the 'H' and the 'W', or neither</li>
					<li>some languages are forced to implement different forms, such as "HELLO WORLD"</li>
					<li>for devices such as microcontrollers, "Hello, World" may thus be substituted with a blinking LED</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>Some facts</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>A "Hello, World!" program is traditionally used to introduce novice programmers to a programming language</li>
					<li>"Hello, world!" is also traditionally used in a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed, and that the operator understands how to use it</li>
					<li>The tradition of using the phrase "Hello, world!" as a test message was influenced by an example program in the seminal book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_C_Programming_Language_(book)">The C Programming Language</a></li>
